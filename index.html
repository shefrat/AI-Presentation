							<p>AI is it DANGEROUS ?</p>
						</font>
						<p align="left">
							Most researchers agree that a superintelligent AI is unlikely to exhibit human emotions like love or hate, and that there is no reason to expect AI to become intentionally benevolent or malevolent. Instead, when considering how AI might become a risk, experts think two main scenarios :

						<p>
							The AI is programmed to do something devastating: Autonomous weapons are artificial intelligence systems that are programmed to kill. In the hands of the wrong person, these weapons could easily cause mass casualties.

							The AI is programmed to do something beneficial, but it develops a destructive method for achieving its goal.

						<p>
 								This can happen whenever we fail to fully align the AIâ€™s goals with ours, which is strikingly difficult. If you ask an obedient intelligent car to take you to the airport as fast as possible, it might get you there chased by helicopters and covered in vomit, doing not what you wanted but literally what you asked for. If a superintelligent system is tasked with a ambitious geoengineering project, it might wreak havoc with our ecosystem as a side effect, and view human attempts to stop it as a threat to be met.

					<h2>Conclusion</h2>
					<p>Artificial Intelligence is gaining popularity at a quicker pace. influencing the way we live, interact and improve customer experience. There is much more to come in the coming years with more improvements and development.
